## 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a passion for building scalable, high-performing web applications. I hold a master's degree in Information and Software Engineering from the Faculty of Organization and Informatics (FOI), where I completed my thesis on **"Developing GraphQL Web Services in Spring and Adobe Experience Manager"** in collaboration with ecx.io, an IBM iX company.

Currently, I work as an AEM Developer at IBM iX, contributing to enterprise-level web solutions through backend and component development.

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Integrating GraphQL APIs within AEM using Spring Boot
